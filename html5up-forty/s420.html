										<h2>The origin of the project</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The source of this project is a french entrepreneur, ingenious and passionate about
										sailing. This man, living and working in the south of Seine-et-Marne
										had no possibility of encountering varied sailing conditions worthy of
										the high seas, he decided to build and have built a navigation device, more
										precisely a dinghy simulator to promote the training of skippers and others
										pilots in varied weather conditions while staying at home.</p>

												<h3>A short summary</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The project took shape, the simulator was built, tests and uses were carried out
												with the inevitable imperfections or limitations of the machine. Subsequently, our
												entrepreneur always in search of new sensations then became passionate
												for aeronautics and has embarked on the training of airline pilots, thus abandoning the
												navigation, thus placing his "mechanical sailboat" at the landfill.</br>
												
													During 2014, the shipyard located in the town of Thomery just on the other side of
													the Seine, in front of the Lycée La Fayette lets teachers know that a "mechanical sailboat
													Was abandoned, so the teachers recovered it to avoid throwing it away.
													After further research, this "mechanical sailboat" was in truth a "dinghy
													type S420 ”mounted on a complex metal frame, this frame is itself
													piloted to recreate the conditions and sensations of navigation but in
													staying on earth.</p>
													<p>
														Lycée La Fayette which had already participated in the development and construction in the past
														of several elements of this model remained very interested in this dinghy, but this
														This time, this dinghy would be used for the training of the students of the Lycée La Fayette. In
														on the other hand, the mechanics and technology used for the simulator remain current, its appearance and the bulk it generates make it, however, obsolete, it is
														why a return to the workshop was inevitable
														Thus, the dinghy was placed in the hall of the workshops of the Lycée La Fayette de Champagne on
														Seine in July 2014. Installed in a corner of the workshop, the simulator will be reborn.</p>

												<p>The model could be summarized as follows: it is about a real dinghy mounted on a
												structure allowing movements of the hull along three perpendicular axes, in
												three dimensions.</p>

												<h3>My personal tasks</h3>
											</header>
											<ul>
												<li>Identify the boat's position on Unity</li>
												<li>Display of values</li>
												<li>Convert Unity units to GPS coordinates</li>
												<li>Transmit values ​​using ModBus communication protocol</li>
												
											</ul>
											<p>A "GameObject" can represent a character, a scene or another prop on Unity, it
												always has a Transform component to have information on the position, the rotation
												and the size of an object.</p>
												<img src="images/units.JPG" alt="" data-position="top center" />
											<p>
												It will be necessary to access the following two fields, therefore X and Z.
												for this it is necessary to go through the Transform function as well as the desired control
												to access.</br>
												
												Once in possession of these two data, using ModBus Protocol i was able to transmit this data to a mobile application. 

											</p>



											<p>Modbus is a protocol for
												communication used for networks
												programmable controllers. The protocol
												Modbus can be used in two ways
												different. 
												

												<ul>
													<li>In RTU (RS-232; RS-422): A single active master, several passive slaves. This is
														the master who must read and write to each slave. RTU mode consists of
														of frames containing the slave number, the function to be processed (read /
														write), the data and the verification code called CRC16.</li>
													<li>In TCP (Ethernet): Several active clients, one passive server, each client
														reads and writes in the server. TCP mode is made up of frames containing the
														function to be processed (read / write) and the data.</li>
													
												</ul>
												We used the ModBus TCP / IP protocol because we
												want to have a server that accepts multiple clients. Once the data transfer has been completed and validated I was able to move forward. 
												The next step was to convert the unity data into GPS coordinates.   </p>

											<p>
												Since this was a real bay in western France near Brest, we managed to identify the starting point of the boat on the simulation.
												
											</p>
											<a><img src="images/brestBay.JPG" alt="" data-position="top center" />	</a>
											<p>
												<ul>
													<li>
														Latitude is the angle of the earth and the position of the boat in Z.
													</li>
													<li>
														Longitude is the difference in time resulting from the time it takes for the sun to pass midday from one meridian to another.

													</li>

											<a><img src="images/formule.JPG" alt="" data-position="top center" />	</a>
											<p>Using this mathematical formula I was able to convert GPS coordinates into XX ° YYY'ZZZ" format and display it. The data conversion allows first of all to add a tangent which will make it possible to calculate the new values.</br>
												The previous formula resulted in this script : 
											</p>
											

											
											
											
									
										<code>angle_z = Math.Atan(z_boat / rayon) * ( 180  / Math.PI ); </br></code>
										<code>	angle_x =  Math.Atan(x_boat / rayon ) * (180  / Math.PI);</br></code>
										<code>  lat_boat_d = lat_bay_d + angle_x;</br></code>
										<code> 	long_boat_d = long_bay_d + angle_z; </br></code>
										<code>	lat_boat[0] = Mathf.FloorToInt((float)lat_boat_d); </br></code>
										<code>	lat_boat[1] = (Mathf.FloorToInt(((float)lat_boat_d -   </br></code>	
										<code>	Mathf.Floor   ToInt((float)lat_boat_d)) * 60  ) ) ; </br></code>	
										<code>	float tmp = ((float)lat_boat_d - Mathf.FloorToInt((float)lat_boat_d)) * 60   ;  </br></code>
										<code>	lat_boat[2] = Mathf.FloorToInt((tmp - Mathf.FloorToInt(tmp) )* 60 ) ; </code>	
										
									</br> 
										
											

											<p>
												I used arrays to stock every integer in my three values to display ; </br>
												<code>index[0]=Degrees => lat_boat[0] = Mathf.FloorToInt((float)lat_boat_d) ; </br></code>  
												<code> index[1]=Minutes => lat_boat[1] = (Mathf.FloorToInt(((float)lat_boat_d - </br></code>
												<code>	Mathf.Floor ToInt((float)lat_boat_d)) * 60 ) ) ;</br> </code>
												<code> index[2]=Seconds => lat_boat[2] = Mathf.FloorToInt((tmp - Mathf.FloorToInt(tmp) )* 60 ) ;</br> </code>

												<h3>My proposals to the project</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												In a second part of the project, I had to show my creativity and what it could be add to the project. My decisions focused on functionalities that could better situate 
												the user on the simulation.
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Minimap</li>
												<li>Horizontal Compass Hud</li>
											</ul>
											<p>The mini-map is one of the essential tools of current simulators and video games, 
												it allows the user to have a precise idea of ​​where he is in the simulation,
												it could be a kind of help to the user if they find themselves lost or about to encounter an unwanted obstacle and thus get around it.
											</p>
											<p><strong>Minimap display : </strong></p>

											
												<img src="images/display1.JPG" alt="" data-position="25% 25%" />
											
											<p>
												
												The horizontal compass is what we could understand as an alternative to a fixed compass, inspired by current video games, 
												I decided to integrate a horizontal compass in the simulation.
												The advantages of this compass are that it saves space and, above all, the user does not need to take his eyes off his course at any time to know his position and his heading,
												 it can be a very interesting alternative to the compass or a complement to it.

										<h2>My conclusion about this project :</h2>
									</header>
									<p>To conclude this project brought me a lot on the theoretical level, for several weeks I had to call on my creativity or my ability to collect information to advance in my project.
										My tasks were confusing at first and then over the weeks I realized that I had to collect information and apply it, </br>
										moreover I had a lot of pleasure in carrying out my tasks because for each of them I saw precisely the usefulness, I also had this part of aesthetics on all the tools that I could develop for the User-Interface.</p>
